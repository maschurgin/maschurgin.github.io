<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:rgb(104, 100, 100)"><a href="publications.html"> Schurgin &amp;  Flombaum (2018).&nbsp;<em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception &amp; Performance</em>&#8203;</a></span></div>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center;"><strong><font size="5">Abstract</font></strong></div>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Human visual memory is tolerant, meaning that it supports object recognition despite variability across encounters at the image level. Tolerant object recognition remains one capacity in which artificial intelligence trails humans. Typically, tolerance is described as a property of human visual long-term memory (VLTM). In contrast, visual working memory (VWM) is not usually ascribed a role in tolerant recognition, with tests of that system usually demanding discriminatory power -identifying changes, not sameness. There are good reasons to expect that VLTM is more tolerant; functionally, recognition over the long term must accommodate the fact that objects will not be viewed under identical conditions; and practically, the passive and massive nature of VLTM may impose relatively permissive criteria for thinking that two inputs are the same. But empirically, tolerance has never been compared across working and long-term visual memory. We therefore developed a novel paradigm for equating encoding and test across different memory types. In each experiment trial, participants saw two objects, memory for one tested immediately (VWM) and later for the other (VLTM). VWM performance was better than VLTM and remained robust despite the introduction of image and object variability. In contrast, VLTM performance suffered linearly as more variability was introduced into test stimuli. Additional experiments excluded interference effects as causes for the observed differences. These results suggest the possibility of a previously unidentified role for VWM in the acquisition of tolerant representations for object recognition.</div>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><font size="4"><strong>General Procedure</strong></font></div>

<span class='imgPusher' style='float:left;height:0px'></span><span style='display: table;width:auto;position:relative;float:left;max-width:100%;;clear:left;margin-top:0px;*margin-top:0px'><a><img src="uploads/2/5/3/0/25304531/figures-001_orig.png?" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 40px; border-width:0; max-width:100%" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder wsite-image" /></a><span style="display: table-caption; caption-side: bottom; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -0px; margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: center;" class="wsite-caption"></span></span>
<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">&#8203;In order to assess the tolerance of visual working and long-term memory, we designed a paradigm that placed these two systems on equal footing. Participants were initially exposed to two (or more) real-world objects in a trial. After a brief delay, one of the objects was paired with a new object and the task was to indicate which was in the recently seen set. After completing the visual working memory task, a long-term memory test probed the previously untested objects against foils using the same testing procedure. Thus, both objects in a trial were encoded at the same time, with both as candidates for a short-term or a long-term test. And both objects were tested in exactly the same way, with participants asked to pick out the previously seen object from a pair that included only one that was previously shown (along with a foil).<br /><br />&#8203;As a result, the only difference in behavioral performance could be a result of whether&nbsp;an object representation was probed over the short-term (in VWM) or the long-term (in VLTM).</div>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><font size="4"><strong>Experiments 1-2: Tolerance Across Variability at Test</strong></font></div>

<div class="paragraph">Once representations had been encoded into VWM and VLTM, we assessed the relative tolerance of these two systems by adding variability at test. Whether variability was added via injecting random noise (Experiment 1b) or changing the orientation of the studied image (Experiment 2), visual working memory was robustly tolerant to change. In contrast, visual long-term memory performance suffered linearly as variability was added at test.&nbsp;</div>

<span class='imgPusher' style='float:right;height:102px'></span><span style='display: table;width:auto;position:relative;float:right;max-width:100%;;clear:right;margin-top:20px;*margin-top:40px'><a><img src="uploads/2/5/3/0/25304531/figures-007_orig.png?" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; border-width:0; max-width:100%" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder wsite-image" /></a><span style="display: table-caption; caption-side: bottom; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;" class="wsite-caption"></span></span>
<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">Interference is a well-known cause of difficulty in long-term memory retrieval. For example, in verbal long-term memory recall performance for a single syllable does not degrade over time, even if other types of memory contents need to be stored. But if multiple syllables need to be remembered performance decreases as the retention interval increases, suggesting a role for mutual interference between memoranda in long-term memory (Keppel &amp; Underwood, 1962). A concern in Experiments 1 and 2 therefore is that long-term relative intolerance (compared to visual working memory) may be caused by inter-item interference since a set of items larger than two must be stored before the long-term memory test takes place. <br /><br />We addressed this concern in Experiment 3, a one trial version of Experiment 1a. Participants did only one trial of the visual working memory task, in which they were shown two objects and then tested immediately for memory of one of them. The other item was saved while the participant completed an unrelated study (one of a number of the other experiments in the lab that did not include images of real-world objects). Finally, the participant was asked to identify the second previously shown object from a pair of images that included a foil, i.e. the participant was given a surprise VLTM test probing the saved image from the previous VWM trial. In this way, the VLTM test took place without the potential for interference among a large set of exposure images. <br /><br />We found similar performance relative to Experiment 1a,&nbsp;suggesting average performance differences were not the result of interference between memoranda. This is the only single trial experiment on VLTM that we are aware of. It provides evidence that VLTM intolerance is not caused exclusively by interference, and also reinforces the motivation to distinguish between VLTM and VWM.</div>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><font size="4"><strong>Experiment 4: VWM Robustly Tolerant Despite Pressured Capacity</strong></font></div>

<span class='imgPusher' style='float:left;height:0px'></span><span style='display: table;width:auto;position:relative;float:left;max-width:100%;;clear:left;margin-top:0px;*margin-top:0px'><a><img src="uploads/2/5/3/0/25304531/published/figures-016.png?1516930123" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px; border-width:0; max-width:100%" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorder wsite-image" /></a><span style="display: table-caption; caption-side: bottom; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;" class="wsite-caption"></span></span>
<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">In Experiments 4a and 4b we sought to investigate tolerance in VWM when memory capacity is pressured. Capacity limitation is among the defining characteristics of VWM, with apparent constraints on the number of items a person can maintain in memory simultaneously (Vogel, Woodman &amp; Luck, 2001; Awh, Barton &amp; Vogel, 2007) and on the resolution of representations when more items are maintained, as opposed to fewer (Ma, Husain &amp; Bays, 2014). Experiments 1-3 make it clear that VWM has a high-degree of tolerance when only two items are maintained in memory. But what happens when memory capacity is stretched? Perhaps the effort to allocate resources or to manage competition between representations comes with a cost in terms of tolerance. To investigate this possibility, we conducted an experiment like the ones previous, but involving only a VWM component (i.e. without a long-term test session). Participants saw trials that included images of four objects (i.e. a memory load of 4). Previous research has revealed vastly worse memory performance when four items are maintained in VWM as opposed to two. Participants were instructed to remember all items in each trial, and then after the items disappeared, participants faced an alternative forced choice test in which they indicated which item in a pair was present in the previous set of four. In Experiment 4a, the test images were embedded in either 0% or 75% noise. Experiment 4b extended this type of manipulation to an orientation change. In this experiment, we also varied memory load within subject; each trial included either two or four images. To test memory tolerance, the 2AFC test that followed each trial included one of the previous objects at either the same or a different orientation relative to encoding, along with a previously-unseen foil. Across both experiments, we found performance at SS4 was significantly worse than SS2. However, VWM remained robustly tolerant to noise or orientation changes at test.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="paragraph">
  <p>We conducted three additional experiments in order to address potential alternative accounts or confounding factors in the primary experiments. </p>
  <p><em>Encoding Time (Experiment 5)</em>: It may be that the relative intolerance demonstrated by VLTM reflects inadequate encoding time. To investigate the possibility, we replicated Experiment 2 with increased encoding time from 0.5 to 1 seconds. Again, in VWM we did not observe significant difference for recognizing a previously seen object at the same or different orientation, but VLTM performance was significantly worse at recognizing a previously seen object at a different orientation.</p>
  <p><em>The Role of Color (Experiment 6)</em>: We have emphasized the encoding of objects into working and long-term visual memory. It is possible though that discrimination responses in the tasks rely on lower-level display features. Color, in particular, could be available as a means to discriminate choices in the immediate VWM test, but not the VLTM test. To evaluate this possibility, we replicated Experiment 1b but with completely grayscale images. Despite all stimuli being presented without color information, performance was remarkably similar to Experiment 1b. </p>
  <p><em>Test-induced Forgetting (Experiment 7).</em> The general instructions for the experiments so far presented the VLTM test as a surprise, with the participants at first only told that they would be tested following each trial. Perhaps testing one item in a display immediately led to the strategic forgetting of the other. To evaluate this possibility, we modified the basic paradigm so observers were told they would be tested for long-term memory after the VWM portion of the experiment. Additionally, in half of trials (unpredictably sorted) there was no immediate VWM test after the encoding display. Thus items were available for VLTM testing that were not paired with an already-tested image. We did not find a significant difference in VLTM performance for items that appeared in immediately tested compared to untested displays</p>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><font size="4"><strong>Conclusion</strong></font></div>

<div class="paragraph">Overall, research rarely considers VWM as part of a broader object recognition system. Beyond the descriptive conclusion that at least under some conditions visual working memory is more tolerant than visual long-term memory we therefore propose a novel hypothesis: that visual working memory is a tolerant site for the integration of physical variability so that appropriately tolerant and explicit representations can be encoded into visual long-term memory.</div>
