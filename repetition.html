<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center;"><strong><font size="5">Abstract</font></strong></div>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">A person sees an object once, and then seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks later, she sees it again. How is the person&rsquo;s visual memory for that object changed, improved, or degraded by the second encounter, compared to a situation in which she will have only seen the object once? The answer is unknown, a glaring lacuna in the current understanding of visual episodic memory. The overwhelming majority of research considers recognition following a single exposure to a set of objects, whereas objects reoccur regularly in lived experience. We therefore sought to address some of the more basic and salient questions that are unanswered with respect to how repetition affects visual episodic memory. In particular, we investigated how spacing between repeated encounters affects memory, as well as variable input quality across encounters and changes in viewed orientation. Memory was better when the spacing between encounters was larger, and when a first encounter with an object supplied high quality input (compared to low quality input first, followed later by higher quality input). These experiments lay a foundation for further understanding how memory changes, improves, and degrades over the course of experience.</div>

During incidental encoding, participants saw images of real-world objects twice, embedded in either low (40%) or high (70%) noise across encounters (in addition to single encounter control conditions). At subsequent test, participants saw two images on screen. One image had been previously encoded, whereas the other was a novel foil. For New tests, the foil was a completely new, category distinct image. For Similar tests, the foil was a similar-looking object.</span></span>

Results of Experiment 1. The primary finding was that performance was better when observers first encountered a low-noise image followed by a high-noise image compared to the reverse (i.e. high-noise first). * designates p < 0.05, ~ designates p = 0.09. Error bars represent within-subject error. </span></span>

<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">We first considered the fact that experiences with objects are likely to vary in quality. Therefore, we asked whether memory benefits when a lower quality encounter either precedes or follows a higher quality one? This is an important first question because all three potential outcomes seem plausible. It may be that the last encounter an observer has with an object has the greatest bearing on subsequent long-term memory performance: a recency-effect. In contrast, it may be that when observers are first given a high-quality encounter this fosters better conditions for the assimilation of information in the future, resulting in more robust memories. And of course, it is possible that memory is commutative (like addition), with a poorer input and a better input always assimilating to the same endpoint, regardless of the sequence.<br /><br />To answer this question, we presented participants with a stream of real-world objects during an encoding phase. Each image in the stream appeared twice, and each image was embedded in variable noise. To create noise, we randomly scrambled a percentage of pixels in each image, a technique that was successful in previous experiments (Schurgin &amp; Flombaum, 2015; Schurgin &amp; Flombaum, 2018). The logic is that randomly scrambling pixels is a way to continuously degrade the ability to recognize an object, hopefully approximating the effects of a variety of real world factors that would do the same, such as dim lighting, viewing from a distance, or viewing through a partially transparent surface. By varying the amount of noise, we sought specifically to control the quality of input during first and second encounters. In addition to presenting some objects in high-noise first, and some in low-noise first, we also presented some objects with low-noise (i.e. better input) on both occasions, some with more noise on both occasions, and we also included images that appeared only once, with either high or low noise; these four extra conditions were intended to supply baselines for comparison.&nbsp;<br /><br />The main result was that a low-noise encounter followed by a high-noise encounter supported better recognition performance than the reverse (i.e. high-noise first). This is consistent with an integration mechanism in which a high-fidelity exposure forms a basis that allows more information to be gleaned from a later low-fidelity exposure. This could be realized, for example, if pattern completion (see Yassa &amp; Stark, 2011) depends more on the strength of the stored information that triggers it, as opposed to the quality of the incoming information that becomes assimilated. Regardless of specific mechanism, the result is descriptively interesting, perhaps even surprising. Recognition performance was <em>worse</em> when the exemplar that observers saw most <em>recently</em> was the <em>better fidelity</em> one.&nbsp;</div>

Results of Experiment 2. Across both Original Orientation and New Orientation tests, we failed to find a significant difference whether an object had been encountered during encoding twice from the same orientation (Consistent Encounters) or two different orientations (Variable Encounters). Error bars represent within-subject error.</span></span>

<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;"><span>Orientation or viewpoint changes are a typical type of everyday variability; the same object will rarely (if ever) be seen from the exact same orientation as before, introducing dramatic changes to surface feature information across encounters (DiCarlo &amp; Cox, 2007; Rust, &amp; Stocker, 2010). We sought to investigate what happens when observers see an object twice from the same compared with two different orientations, conditions we will call Consistent Encounters and Variable Encounters. We also manipulated orientation at test, sometimes showing an object at one of the orientations in which it was shown before, and sometimes showing an object at a third, never-before-shown orientation. During test, the object was always paired with a new foil, a never-before seen and categorically different object. Therefore, the test manipulation in this experiment was whether target object was shown in an orientation it had been shown in before (Original Orientation Test), or in a new orientation (New Orientation Test; see Figure 3). We predicted that in the New Orientation Test, memory performance would be better in the Variable Encounter condition compared with the Consistent Encounter condition, since having already seen an object from two orientations, as opposed to one, would make it easier to recognize that same object from a never-before-seen orientation.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>We failed to observe that encountering an object twice from two different orientations produced more tolerant memories (Figure 4). But since there was no difference between the encounter conditions with any test, it remains difficult to draw a strong conclusion. The task employed here was perhaps too easy, in general. The high performance observed is likely due in part to all images being presented at encoding without noise and that fewer items were encoded (due to stimuli constraints) relative to Experiment 1. Future research should further investigate how repeated exposures with orientation changes do or do not impact subsequent recognition.&nbsp;</span>&#8203;</div>

<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">What about the amount of time that elapses between two encounters with the same stimulus? Spacing effects have been explored in the context of verbal and semantic episodic memory (Melton, 1970; Smolen, Zhang &amp; Byrne, 2016), but little is known about how variable distance across encounters may affect <em>visual</em> episodic memory.&nbsp;Is it better for a second encounter with an object to take place immediately, or with some time in-between, in terms of later recognition of that object?&nbsp;We explored this question by showing objects twice during an incidental encoding paradigm. (This experiment also included objects that were shown only once, to supply a performance baseline). Here, however, we varied the distances between repetitions in terms of the number of intervening objects shown before a second encounter. Objects were either repeated after one intervening item (i.e. 2-back, which amounted to three seconds between encounters), or they repeated following ten intervening items (i.e. 11-back, amounting to 25.5 seconds between encounters; see Figure 5). At subsequent test, we used the same procedure as in Experiment 1. Participants were given a 2AFC test, where half the trials were &lsquo;New&rsquo; test trials (where the foil was categorically different from the image paired with it) and the other half of trials were &lsquo;Similar&rdquo; test trials involving a categorically similar object as the paired foil.<br /><br />Overall, performance was better for objects encountered twice (2-back or 11-back) compared to once (single exposure). More importantly, for the New test, performance was significantly better for objects encountered in the 11-back compared to the 2-back condition. When additional time between encounters was introduced subsequent recognition performance benefited.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><font size="4"><strong>Conclusion</strong></font></div>

<div class="paragraph">The present results have broad implications for researchers studying memory, learning, and object recognition. They demonstrate the importance of moving past singular experiences to investigate the integration of multiple encounters, and they begin to elucidate the nature of the mechanisms that integrate new input into long-term memories. Specifically, they suggest that these mechanisms function more effectively given an opportunity to consolidate initial encounters, consistent with many other types of non-visual learning (Melton, 1970; Smolen, Zhang &amp; Byrne, 2016). Additionally, our findings suggest that integration works best when an initial encounter supplies a high-quality basis to assimilate with subsequent experiences. It is important to note the present results do not clarify the exact nature of the specific mechanisms producing the observed effects, and alternative explanations may exist. However, we have identified several factors that alter memory quality over repeated encounters, and hope this foundation will assist future researchers in identifying the specific mechanisms that support or degrade visual episodic memory over repeated experiences.&nbsp;<br /></div>
